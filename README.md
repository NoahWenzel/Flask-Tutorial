# Flask-Tutorial
Great reference code produced from following Tech with Tim's Youtube Flask tutorial [linked here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqhxxeeTbu0&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-n4vJJybUVV3Un_NFS5EOgX)

There are 11 videos in this tutorial each building upon eachother. I have organized the code produced into 11 different apps. Each app will reference it's own directory of html files in the templates directory. For example, the code produced from the first video of the series will be in app_1,py which will only access html from the tutorial_1 folder in the templates directory.

Notes: Currently app 1-3 are missing. I had this idea when I was on the 4th video so I could have reference material later on. I am startig on the 4th vido and will back fill the first 3 later.
